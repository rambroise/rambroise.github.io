                <p>Welcome to the online learning course —Medical Practice: More than Just Science.
                As pre-medical students, you've been exposed to a lot of the foundational STEM courses needed to prepare you for more specialized learning in medical school.
                However, the pre-medical curriculum, which focuses heavily on biomedicine, can create a sense of distance and separation between medicine
                and politics. As you will soon see through this course, there exists a co-constitutive relationship between medicine and politics, such that medicine shapes
                politics and the political environment, in turn, also shapes medicine. Thus, in order to be an effective medical practitioner
                in whatever specialty you choose, there needs to first be established an awareness of medicine’s interdependence on politics.</p>

                <p>In this online module, we will be investigating this co-constitutive relationship between medicine and politics in the
                context of political conflict. In times of political discourse, a nation’s political environment occupies a special role in influencing
                many different domains, including medicine. As such, it is during these times that the long-existing connections between medicine and
                conflict can become most visible. Likewise, given the nature of medical practice as a field that affects the quality of health of all individuals,
                medicine in many ways can have great influence in politics, for example, by determining
                who receives what care. In these ways, both politics and medicine can hold power that allows them to influence each other, as will be explored in the
                coming segments of this course.</p>
