            <p>Through investigating the cases presented in this module, the co-constitutive relationship between medicine and
            politics becomes clear, necessitating that physicians be politically aware of the environment in which they practice.</p>

            <h5>Question</h5>
            <form name="Question9">
                <p>Physicians are significantly less likely to vote than people from the following occupations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><input type="radio" value="a">A) lawyers, teachers, farmers</li>

                <h5>Answer: A) lawyers, teachers, farmers</h5>
                <p>Today’s physicians do not demonstrate the level of political awareness that medicine demands.
                Studies have shown that in some recent elections, less than one-third of doctors voted.<sup>3</sup> Nonetheless,
                discussions around matters of health continue to be at the forefront of political affairs as “health care accounts for the
                largest share of the economy, at more than 17 percent of the gross domestic product.”<sup>2</sup> Today, politics and medicine
                continue to cross paths in discussions on topics such as abortion, vaccines, end-of-life care, medical marijuana, Medicare
                and Medicaid funding, undocumented-immigrant care, and gun ownership. Without the expertise of medical practitioners, who
                can offer insight gained from their experiences monitoring the health of the people these policies will affect, we lose an
                essential voice in policy-making.<sup>9</sup></p>

                <p>As history has shown, physicians should not and cannot remain apolitical. Despite claims for neutrality, the surrounding
                legislation and political climate will still affect a physician’s practice either through the limitations that laws may
                create on who can be treated or in altering a physician’s biases in a way that produces health care discrimination. The
                case studies The case studies have shown that ignoring the intersection of medicine and politics makes physicians more
                vulnerable to aid and abet human rights violations. Thus, ethical practice of medicine “necessitates political awareness
                and engagement and action in the face of frank injustices and violations of human rights.”<sup>8</sup></p>

                <p>So what exactly should physicians do to balance the importance of both medicine and politics in their day-to-day practice?</p>

                <h5>Question</h5>
                <form name="Question10">
                    <p>According to the AMA— the United States’ largest physician organization—physicians are encouraged to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="a">A) Be politically active through voting, campaigning, donating, and even running for office</li>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="b">B) Discuss political matters only in contexts where conversation with the patient or family about social, civic, or recreational matters is acceptable</li>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="c">C) Refrain from conversation about political matters when the patient is pressured by significant medical circumstances</li>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="d">D) All of the above</li>
                    </ul>
                </form>
                <button type="button" onclick="reveal10()">Enter</button>
                <left><div id="Answer10" style="display:none">
                    <h5>Answer: D) All of the above</h5>
                    <p>The AMA encourages political activism on behalf of patients through voting, campaigning, donating, and even running for office.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Furthermore, different conflicts in history have created physician-activism groups to recognize and better promote the importance
                    of political awareness in the medical field. For 3 such physician-activism groups are:<sup>13</sup></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Union of Concerned Scientists — founded by scientists and students at MIT in 1969 during the time
                        of the Vietnam War to critically examine government policy regarding science and technology, to advocate
                        for research that addressed social problems, and to fight against the misuse of science for war and the
                        development of nuclear weapons.</li>

                        <li>Physicians for Social Responsibility— formed in 1961 in opposition to nuclear weapons testing
                        and proliferation, and formed to loosen medicine’s attachments to war such that physicians can be
                        in a better position to promote the ethics of care.</li>

                        <li>Physicians for Human Rights— founded in 1986 based on the idea that scientists, physicians, and other
                        health professionals have unique skills and experiences that lend credibility to the investigation of human
                        rights violations and mass atrocities.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>And so the needed change for increased political awareness and activism begins with you as a premedical student.
                    In addition to allocating time to all of your science-related premed courses, begin to also allocate time to becoming
                    an informed citizen so that when the time comes to put on your white coat, you will be equipped with the skills necessary
                    to use the intersection of politics and medicine for the good of your patients.</p>
