            <body>
                <p>From Part I, we’ve seen how the weaponization of medicine in political affairs is a direct consequence of political and
                military strategists recognizing the power of medicine as it can shape the care a population receives for better or for worse.
                In these examples, we’ve seen how medicine has entered the political sphere.
                Nonetheless, there are also many examples of politics entering the medical sphere and shaping medical practice, which we will
                look at in Part II of this training module through 3 selected cases.</p>

                <h3>Case 1: Remodeling Medicine in Third Reich</h3>

                <p>During the early decades of the 20th century, the growth of the eugenics movement, which was based on the belief that human progress
                could be snared on through national breeding programs designed to increase the number of children born to the upper-classes and to discourage
                the expansion of the lower-classes, began to take speed. This evolved into the Nazi ideology that caused the suffering and deaths of Jews and
                other marginalized groups at the expense of pursuing a “pure,” Aryan race.</p>

                <p>The political environment created from this ideology inevitably corrupted the practice of medicine in Germany. As summarized in Michael Kater’s
                Doctors Under Hitler, physicians who were “trained to care for the sick, relieve suffering, and save lives” began withholding care, inflicting pain,
                unethically experimenting on human subjects, and committing murder. Physicians from the time of Nazi Germany first-handedly expressed this shift
                in the professional ethos of medicine, declaring statements such as “because I wish to be a physician, I have to be a National Socialist…the Nazi
                worldview and physicianship condition complement each other.” The political environment left little room for opposition, leading many physicians
                to adopt the notion of viewing Jews and others as “a gangrenous appendix” that needs to be removed from the “diseased body” of the population
                of Germany in order to fulfill their ethical obligations as doctors to “preserve life.”</p>

                <p>Many physicians began to try to find connections between their work in medicine and Nazi ideology, leading to cases of malpractice and
                unethical research. One particularly compelling case of unethical research is discussed in Hidelbrandt’s The Anatomy of Murder, which gives
                insight into the ways in which the work of medical practitioners and researchers alike shifted to prove the circulating racist ideology and
                to use the “material” of prisoners’ bodies offered unreservedly by the government.  Eduard Pernkopf was a famed anatomist who made use of
                the bodies of executioned, political prisoners to construct Pernkopf’s Atlas on the Topographical Anatomy of Man. While today many have
                criticized this atlas, it is hard to reject Pernkopf’s data as even in 2019, it is still considered unsurpassed in comprehensives and
                precision than any other anatomy book. In addition to this atlas, many other commonly used tools and pools of knowledge used in pre-medical
                and medical science courses have been drawn from such unethically sound research and are still used today in medical practice.</p>

                    <p>How should such medical materials that have been derived unethically from the  bodies of executioned, Jewish prisoners be handled today?</p>

                    <h5>Answer: D) A and C</h5>
                    <p>Jewish religious leaders have stated that while they are deeply saddened that German scientists and physicians have
                    exploited their people under the guise of medical advancement, they still believe that if in any case the material produced
                    can save someone’s life, it should be used. However, they do feel strongly that the usage needs to involve respect for those
                    who have suffered and a remembrance for the victims so as to curb the repeating of history in future cases.</p>

                        <p>Despite the U.S. trying to distance themselves for the criminal medical practices that occurred in Germany, the U.S. has its
                        own past of allowing political discourse to corrupt research and medical practice.For example, the Tuskegee Syphilis study conducted
                        with government support between 1932 and 1972 was laden with racist ideology that justified withholding penicillin from the 600
                        black men suffering from syphilis in hopes of justifying fundamentally unequal treatment programs for African-Americans.</p>

                        <p>This deception that was condoned by the political climate continues to have lasting effects on medical practice in America,
                        as it has ultimately hurt physician-patient relationships between minority patients and non-minority doctors.</p>

                        <li>Given the long-lasting consequences of unethical medical practice can have on future practice around the world,
                        physicians must be aware of how the political climate can affect their practice.</li>
                        <li>Political awareness allows physicians to denounce the actions of other doctors, not only within their country but
                        around the world, who under the influence of politics begin to misuse medicine.  Without such political awareness to see
                        political roots of unethical medical practice, we are unable to better prevent such heinous acts in the history of medicine
                        from occurring again.</li>

                <h3>Case 2: Conflict in Kashmir Infiltrating Medicine</h3>
                <p>The issue of sectarian violence in the region of Kashmir quickly became an issue within what was intended to be a
                politically-neutral hospital. Beginning in January of 2005, the District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ) in Kashmir that was
                staffed by Shias, Sunnis, and Ismalis became a “space for political unrest, religious protests, and acts of terrorism,”
                as the Sunni-Shia conflict in the region infiltrated the hospital (Varley 2016).</p>

                <p>According to Varley, the Sunni-Shia conflicts made it nearly impossible for medical practitioners to remain neutral,
                leading to the development of “sectarian logics of care” within the DHQ, whereby providers began to administer care in
                biased ways that aligned with the sect that they supported. This, accordingly, led to persistent fear and distrust from
                patients in not knowing whether or not the actions of medical staff were being influenced by Sunni or Shia ideologies.
                Patients and doctors alike felt it was “impossible to be healthy in Kashmir” due to the ongoing tensions, leading to
                widespread trauma and PTSD within the population.</p>

                <p>In some accounts, too little government intervention is to blame for the ways in which medicine was corrupted by
                the political environment. Interlocutors were cited saying that the government did not do enough to ensure the security
                of patients and medical personnel or to prevent the sectarian violence that resulted in the massacre of patients and providers
                in the DHQ (Varley 2016). Other accounts, however, criticize the Indian state for having too much intervention in the
                humanitarian efforts thereafter that tried to remedy the widespread trauma through therapy programs and mental health
                initiatives.</p>

                <form name="Question6">
                    <p>Throughout the 1990s before the height of the conflict in Kashmir, Indian military officials responded to human

                    <h5>Answer: A) undermining their validity</h5>
                    <p>Prior to the height of the conflict in Kashmir, human rights reports and medical evidence that showed a need
                    for mental health initiatives and therapy for the population where deemed “worthless,” and in some instances “antinational.”</p>
                    <p>However, upon recognizing the power of medicine to gain the support of the Kashmiri during the conflict, the government
                    began using the people’s trauma and PTSD to make political claims, and even co-opted the trauma therapy programs launched by
                    MSF as alternatives to political solutions (Varma 2018). Using these therapy programs, the Indian state attempted to launch
                    its new “healing policy” to win the hearts of those who lived in Indian-occupied Kashmir. Such corrupted motives on behalf of
                    the government negatively affects reception of programs intended for enhancing health.</p>

                        the case study in Kashmir shows that some level of government interaction in medicine is needed to provide

                <h3>Case 3: Political Sentiments Shaping Medicine During the American Civil War</h3>
                <p>The American Civil War was a particularly politically-charged period in the history of the United States as it was
                fought over the controversy of  economics and morality of the enslavement of black people and states’ rights.
                Today, the Civil War is regarded America’s deadliest war, as 500,000 military personnel died, which is almost half of all
                Americans who have ever died during wartime</p>

                <h5>Question</h5>
                <form name="Question7">
                    <p>During the American Civil War, soldiers’ deaths and suffering stemmed mainly from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="a">A) Traumatic, battle-field related injuries</li>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="b">B) Non-traumatic cases </li>
                        <li><input type="radio" value="c">C) Equally of both</li>
                    </ul>
                </form>
                <button type="button" onclick="reveal7()">Enter</button>
                <left><div id="Answer7" style="display:none">
                    <h5>Answer: B) Non-traumatic cases</h5>
                    <p>According to Michael Flannery in his work titled Civil War Pharmacy, the major causes of death are not from the dangers
                    of the battle-field but were from the dangers present within the camps, and the limitations on medical care to safeguard
                    the health of soldiers against these dangers. “The average soldier was about twice as likely to die of a disease contracted
                    in the camp than of a wound acquired in battle,” (22).</p>

                    <p>However, despite the shared environments that both black and white troops had to endure, their mortality outcomes were
                    starkly different, and this was due to the medical care provided. Among black troops, there were 892 cases of camp fevers per
                    1,000, 839 cases of diarrhea/dysentery per 1,000, and 354 cases of respiratory ailments per 1000. “In each category, incidents
                    of illness appreciably exceeded that for white roots, suggesting that medical care in camp and field was substandard compared with
                    that provided for whites,” (23).</p>

                    <p>Political sentiments from the slavery-era affected how physicians provided care to troops based on their rase. As Flannery recount,
                    “Military officials and doctors made a number of claims about black people’s physiology, from arguments that black men were innately
                    invulnerable to fever and thereby better suited to be stationed in the swampy climes of Louisiana to the false notion that black
                    men fell victim to dysentery because of their dietary habits of slavery.” In this way, we see how the political climate can
                    influence doctors in how they administer treatment and justify these  different forms of care.</p>

                        <p>Studies from the University of California— San Francisco indicate that even 150 year since the American Civil War,
                        discrimination in health care is still a large problem. Interestingly, “blacks’ reports of discrimination actually
                        increase as wealth increases,” suggesting that a significant number of cases of healthcare discrimination go unreported.</p>

                            <p>Today, the political discourse in our country on how we view immigrants, minorities, or other marginalized groups
                            can shape how we practice medicine.</p>
                            <p>A study on health discrimination in physicians’ diagnoses was conducted by assessing 720 physicians at 2 national
                            meetings of organization of primary care physicians. The assessment involved having the physician watch recorded
                            interviews about hypothetical patients, and then make recommendations for the patients. The actors in the recorded
                            interviews presented the same symptoms, and only differed in whether or not they were male, female, black, or white.
                            The outcome of this test was that race and sex of a patient influence how physicians manage chest pain. For example,
                            black women were significantly less likely to be referred for catheterization than white men, with an odds ratio of
                            0.4.</p>

                        <p>The long-standing history of how political discourse as affected medicine and continues to influence physicians’
                        decisions when administering care verifies that physicians cannot practice medicine in a vacuum. Rather, physicians
                        are going to be influenced by the political environment around them. Thus it is important that doctors have an awareness
                        of the context in which they practice and how that shapes the biases they may form in order to progress past current issues
                        of health discrimination.</p>
