                <p>The Algerian War of Independence (1954—1962) between French colonial forces and the National Liberation Front (FLN)
                — which was the nationalist political party leading the movement for independence— does not at first glance indicate
                any relation between the two opposing forces in their political discourse and the use of medicine. Many accounts have
                depicted this conflict as a strictly military affair, wrought with physical violence and political strategies from both
                sides to attain power.</p>

                    <h5><center>Answer: D) All of the Above</center></h5>
                    <p>Research that involved acquiring
                    information from Algerian sources, demonstrates that “the fight between the two sides was not simply
                    a military affair; it also involved diverse and competing claims about how was positioned to better
                    care for the Algerian people’s health and welfare.”<sup>6</sup></p>

                    <left><p>Winning the support of the residing population is essential in the fight for sovereignty, and both sides
                    understood that demonstrations of military power through wars and physical violence can only do so much good before causing
                    harm in this fight.  In order to counterbalance the terror and stress inflicted on the residing population from the
                    military violence, the combating forces needed to somehow show the people that they also are capable of caring for them,
                    protecting them, and safeguarding their health. This was ultimately done through abstracting medical practice to serve their
                    own political agendas in their war efforts. The nationalist leadership constructed national health care-institutions
                    that provided care for the population to demonstrate that they were able to effectively care for their own people. This
                    ultimately contributed to obtaining international recognition of Algerian sovereignty.<sup>6</sup></p></left>

                    <p>Despite losing the war, the French also used medicine and health care to try to secure
                    the support of the population through the establishment of the Sections Administratives Spécialisées (SAS)
                    — “the most comprehensive wartime initiative, aimed to facilitate political rapprochement between the Algerian
                    population and the colonial state.”<sup>6</sup> This initiative involved sending physicians, nurses, and other
                    medical personnel as political ambassadors to rural areas to provide free care, and ultimately to
                    “conquer with medicine rather than bullets.”</p>

                        <p align="left">In this way, medicine not only in the context of Algeria but around the world, can serve political purposes whether
                        intended or not. The care that people receive from their medical practitioners forms their ideas of how reliable
                        and effective the political institutions leading their country are.</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p align="left">This inevitable relation that links medical
                        practitioners to politics makes it hard for the medical field to remain apolitical, and necessitates that practitioners
                        have a strong awareness of the political environment in which they practice.</p>

                <h3 class="head">Case 2: Weaponizing Medicine to Cripple a Nation — U.S. Occupation of Iraq</h3>
                <p>The idea of compromising the ethics of medicine by politicizing its usage is not foreign to U.S. military
                strategists. Under the Bush Administration, laws were established during the Global War on Terror to allow privately held
                corporations to “rebuild” Iraq and Afghanistan in ways that undermined the health and nutrition of local populations.
                This was done through the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA)— a transitional government in Iraq— which
                privatized the previously state-run Iraqi health care system.<sup>13</sup></p>
                <p></p>

                <p>This directly affected medical practitioners in Iraq and the care
                they were able to provide as it banned thousands of Iraqi physicians and nurses from public-sector employment. As the U.S. invasion
                in Iraq evolved into long-term occupation, the sectarian political system created by the CPA was met with opposition from the Iraqi
                population, which inevitably caused Iraqi physicians who were working within the CPA’s new health system to be targeted for violence.
                This use of healthcare to accomplish a political agenda ultimately “contributed to the chaotic conditions that helped plunge
                Iraq into an acute-on-chronic public health emergency, which it still remains in today.”<sup>13</sup> </p>

                    <h5>Answer: B) U.S. Military</h5>
                    <p>The U.S. military is so far the biggest investor in the field of regenerative medicine,
                    which was “formally recognized by the military when it established the Armed Forces Institute
                    of Regenerative Medicine in 2008.”<sup>13</sup></p>
                    <p>Throughout the American wars waged in Iraq and Afghanistan, biomedicine and the ethics of
                    care of medical practice have been used to obscure the root causes and effects of violence from war.
                    For example, there is a "destroy-and-build logic" whereby
                    science is used to create novel, and more damaging explosives for warfare, and medicine is used as a tool
                    to salvage new forms of wounds and trauma to allow for continued violence.<sup>13</sup></p>

                    <p>While inarguably complicated, these devastating cases of physical trauma from explosives can now be survived due to
                    advancements in blood-clotting products, rapid emergency evacuation procedures, and other biomedical improvements.
                    However, these “improvements” in medicine disguise the need to end the escalating violence created by warfare that
                    contradicts the purpose of medicine and the ethics of care in the first place. </p>

                <p>Another key example of medicine being weaponized is in the usage of medicine under the Obama Administration in Pakistan.
                Many recall the military operation that led to the assassination of Osama bin Laden in the context of the 40 minute-long military mission,
                during which U.S. special forces were able to raid an al-Qaeda compound, find, and kill bin Laden. However, this narrative neglects the
                importance of the use of medicine to achieve what today is praised as a “flawless mission.” Interestingly,
                the military operation first began through the U.S. government using sham vaccination campaigns to gather intelligence on bin Laden’s DNA and
                location.<sup>13</sup></p>
